> PlayPalMini is a mini version of a group task which was the final exam of an intensive 255-hour beginner back-end dev course. The original was a 4 man project called PlayPal, an MVC application where the database theme was about renting board games. PlayPalMini is a simplified version of that, but intended to cover all the same features.
